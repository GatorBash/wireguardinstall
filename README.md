# WireguardInstall

I've made several scripts posted here to make life a little better.
I hope you find it helpful

# Requirements 

This set of scripts is intended to be used on Debian based computers.
If you aren't using Debian you'll need to change the package manager.
Of course you'll also need an internet connection.

# How to use this

You'll need to do just a couple of things.
- Make sure you're logged in as root.  You can do this with `sudo -i`
- Ensure that you're connected to the internet.
- **Before** you do anything you will need to `cd` into the wireguardinstall directory.
- Then you will need to make the install script exitcutable.
- `chomod +x  fullwginstall.sh`
- `./fullwginstall.sh`
